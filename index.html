      This configuration is a Pan-STARRS like cadence. It contains the Universal (WFD) proposal that requires pairs of visits and no other proposals. The area coverage is increased to include Dec <+15 deg (~27,400 deg^2) and the default airmass limit of 1.5 is kept. It also uses the SRD number of visits for each band.
