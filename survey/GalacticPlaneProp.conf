#====================================================================
#   Priority Ranking Scheme across all Proposals
#
#   All proposals use the same ranking scale of values [0.0 : 1.0] .
#       Rank 0.0  indicates that, in the current context of the proposal,
#           a Field should not be observed.
#       Rank 0.1 is a 'stand-by' rank indicating that the Field is ready to
#           be observed (butthere is no urgency).
#       Rank 0.5 indicates increasing urgency to observe the Field due to
#           the Proposal's scheduling requirements. Few Fields at any moment
#           should have such a high priority.
#       Rank 1.0 indicates urgent need to observe the Field.  Failure to
#           observe immediately will cause the current sequence to abort.
