# 2-Each subsequence needs a name, any single-word-string or number.
#                                                                             
# 3-The SubSeqFilters keyword describes the series of filters to use in a
# single event (or complex event).
#                                                                            
# 4-The SubSeqExposures keyword describes the number of repeated exposures for
# each one of the respective filters in SubSeqFilters. All these exposures will
# be taken in a single observation block, one after the other, changing the
# filter as indicated. There is no limit in the number of filters to use in
# this "microsequence". Other proposals cannot interrupt the completion of
# this complex event, but will analyze the exposures for serendipity. The
# complex-event can be interrupted by downtime like clouds, end of night, etc.
# In case of interruption, the event is missed.
#                                                                           
# 5-The event is proposed only if all the required filters are available from
# sky brightness criteria.

# 6-All the other parameters have exactly the same meaning as in SNSS proposal.
#                                                                        
# The example above says that the master subsequence is "main", the whole
# sequence must start with that one. The "main" subsequence needs 4 events
# with an interval of 1 day; each interval is composed of 3 r consecutive
# exposures followed by 4 i exposures. Only 1 event can be missed without
# losing the whole sequence.
# The subsequence "extra" has 3 events, each one composed of 10 consecutive g
# exposures.
# The subsequence "last" has 2 events, none can be missed, each one composed
# of 10 r exposures, followed by 3 i and finally 2 y.
#                                                   
# 7-The ObsScheduler was modified to support this complex-events. It works the
# same way as before, computing 20 (parameter) observations in a block to save
# cpu. If one observation from KBO is taken, then this proposal gains the
# exclusive attention from the scheduler while the complex-event is observed.
# Each exposure is sent with a special flag to all the other proposals to
# check for serendipity. Once the complex-event is finished, the scheduler
# returns to its normal block of 20 mode.
#                                                
#==========================================================================
#==========================================================================
#   Priority Ranking Scheme across all Proposals
#
#   All proposals use the same ranking scale of values [0.0 : 1.0] .
#       Rank 0.0  indicates that, in the current context of the proposal, 
#           a Field should not be observed.
#       Rank 0.1 is a 'stand-by' rank indicating that the Field is ready to
#           be observed (but there is no urgency).
#       Rank 0.5 indicates increasing urgency to observe the Field due to 
#           the Proposal's scheduling requirements. Few Fields at any moment
#           should have such a high priority.
#       Rank 1.0 indicates urgent need to observe the Field.  Failure to 
#           observe immediately will cause the current subsequence to abort.
#====================================================================
#   Priority Ranking within a Sequenced-Events Proposal
#
#   A Sequenced-event proposal uses the closeness between the current 
#       Simulation Time and the Next Event time as the primary ranking 
#       criteria for a Field.
#
#       A timing window is constructed from the time interval between 
#       the next Visit and the previous Visit. From that interval an urgency 
#       scale is created to the precision required.
#
#   The normalized time scale used is as follows:
#       normalizedT = (currentTime-nextVisitTime)/(nextVisitTime-lastVisitTime)
#
#   The priority ranking of an observing visit starts rising at "WindowStart";
#       it reaches a maximum value at "WindowMax"; and it is
#       abandoned at "WindowEnd" if it still hasn't been observed.
#   
#   Using defaults: WindowStart=-0.20, WindowMax=0.20; WindowEnd=4.0,
#       The priority begins rising at (0.2 * normalizedT) before the Visit time;
#       it reaches the maximum priority at (0.2 * normalizedT) after the event 
#       time; and returns to lowest prioirty at (0.4 * normalizedT) after 
#       the Visit time.  
#       Note: negative indicates *before* Visit time, positive is *after* Visit.
