# NEO Run 1

Configuration is basically the same as the baseline cadence:
WFD, NES, SCP, GP, and DD fields have the same sky coverage.
WFD has 1.5 times more visits than baseline (master) - 113/157/360/360/315/315 in ugrizy.
NES has the same number of visits in griz.
(SCP, GP, and DD have same number of requested fields; DD will repeat throughout entire survey though).
