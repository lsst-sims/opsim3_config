# Baseline Cadence

* Science Council approved Deep Drilling fields
* Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) design specification for areal coverage (18,000 deg)
* WFD "boosted visits" = 75, 105, 240, 240, 210, 210 for u, g, r, i, z, y filters 
  where g, r, i and z visits are collected in pairs separated by 
  about 30 minutes
* Revised scheduled downtime and unscheduled downtime
* minAlt = 20 deg
* MinDistance2Moon = 30 deg

**Note:** 
SRD design visits = 56, 80, 184, 184, 160, 160 for u, g, r, i, z, y filters.
