# Baseline Cadence - 15 year version.

* Science Council approved Deep Drilling fields
* Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) design specification for areal coverage (18,000 deg)
* WFD "boosted visits" = 113/157/360/360/315/315 (baseline * 1.5) for u/g/r/i/z/y
  where g, r, i and z visits are collected in pairs separated by 
  about 30 minutes
* Revised scheduled downtime and unscheduled downtime
* minAlt = 20 deg
* MinDistance2Moon = 30 deg

**Note:** 
SRD design visits = 56, 80, 184, 184, 160, 160 for u, g, r, i, z, y filters.

Increased number of visits requested in NES by 1.5 to 60/138/138/120 in griz
(below neo/run01 which requests more visits in NES).
