# Simple rolling cadence test.

WFD split into N, M, S zones - north, middle, south. Only these proposals included.
"Rolling" cadence by concentrating on the north, then the middle, then the south.
No coverage for these zones in 'off' years.
Overall length of survey reduced to 9 years, to account for the fact that we are not
including DD, NES, GP, or SCP proposals.
