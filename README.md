# NEO Run 3

WFD covers standard region, with visits appropriate for 15 years (113/157/360/360/315/315).
NEO proposals -- the NES is removed, and replaced by a single "EclipticBand" proposal.
The Ecliptic Band proposal covers +/- 12 degrees around the entire ecliptic, with an extension
down to the top of the WFD region (where it was above the dec limit of the WFD).
This proposal requests sequences of visits - 2 back-to-back visits -- to make "equivalent" of 60s
visits.
