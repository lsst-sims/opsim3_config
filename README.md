# NEO Run 6

Configuration is the same as NEO Run 4 except Ecliptic Band proposal now covers
~+/- 15 degrees around the ecliptic, where the declination is less than the max
northern limit of the WFD, then the NES remains above dec=0 (so we get a little
less range of coverage north of the ecliptic, above dec=0 than in NEO5).
