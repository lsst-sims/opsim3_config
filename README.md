# Tier 1, Run 9

This configuration is a Pan-STARRS like cadence. It contains the Universal (WFD)
proposal that requires pairs of visits and no other proposals. The area
coverage is increased to include Dec <+15 deg (~27,400 deg^2) and the default
airmass limit of 1.5 is kept. It also uses the SRD number of visits for each 
band.
