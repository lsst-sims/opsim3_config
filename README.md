# NEO Run 7

Ecliptic band proposal is +/-15 degrees, around the entire ecliptic and down to the top of the WFD.
Ecliptic band proposal is in r and i bands only and requests back-to-back visits.
NES is still active, but only requests g and z observations (to round out colors), and only requests single visits.
Number of visits for EclipticBand and NES is equivalent to 2x and 1x the WFD visits.
Discovery 'should' be focused on EclipticBand observations.
