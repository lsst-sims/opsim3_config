# NEO Run 5

Configuration is the same as NEO Run 3 except the Ecliptic Band proposal now
covers ~+/- 15 degrees around the ecliptic, and does have an extension down
to the WFD region.
Ecliptic band proposal requests back-to-back visits (for equivalent 60s visit depth).
EB requests equivalent of 2x WFD visits (due to back-to-back visits).
