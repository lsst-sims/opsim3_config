# NEO Run 8

Attempts at very NEO-optimized runs.

Ecliptic band proposal is +/-15 degrees, around the entire ecliptic.
Ecliptic band proposal requests back-to-back visits for deeper observations.

NES, DD, SCP, GP proposals are dropped.
WFD is active and extends 'up' to +15 degree region of EB. Single visits, for half-depth of EB.
 
All observations are in gri only. Different commits = different requested visit times and possibly filters.
